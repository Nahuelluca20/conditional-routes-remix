# Conditional Routes in Remix

In this small demo I try to replicate in Remix the functionality of [Nextjs Conditional Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#conditional-routes).

If you want to know there is a [tutorial on my blog](https://nahuel-dev.pages.dev/blog/conditional-routes-remix).
